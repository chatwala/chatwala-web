	<h1>Chatwala Privacy Policy</h1>
	<i>Last Updated: January 1, 2014</i>
	<p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Chatwala, Inc. (“we”, “our” or “us”) on the collection, use and disclosure of your information on the Chatwala mobile application (the “Application”) and the services, features, content we offer (collectively, the “Services”). We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) your use of the Services generally; (ii) if you register for the Services, through your user account on the Services (your “Account”); and (iii) from third party websites and services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>
	<p>This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.
	<br>
	This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.
	</p>
	<h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
	<p>The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.</p>
	<h5>Account Information:</h5>
	<p>When you create an Account, you will provide information that could be Personal Information, such as your name, username, password, phone number, and email address. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an account on the Services and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, but only rarely when we feel such information is important. You may unsubscribe from these messages through your Account settings, although we, regardless, reserve the right to contact you when we believe it is necessary, such as for account recovery purposes. 
	</p>
	<h5>Video Messages:</h5>
	<p>When you send messages through the Services, including automatically recorded videos of your reactions to messages you receive, we collect, process, and store the contents of the video messages on our servers. The contents of messages are also stored on the devices of the people you send the messages to. We cannot prevent others from making copies of your messages (e.g., by taking a screenshot) or forwarding your messages to others. In addition, as for any other digital information, there may be ways to access video messages while they are still in storage on recipients’ devices or possibly even after the messages are deleted. You should not use the Services to send messages if you want to be certain that the recipient cannot keep a copy. 
	</p>
	<h5>User Content:</h5>
	<p>Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written comments. All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy. 
	</p>
	<h5>IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:</h5>
	<p>
		<ul>
		<li>We may automatically receive and record information from your mobile device or web browser when you interact with the Services, including IP address and cookie information. This information is used to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services</li>
		<li>Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency with which users access the Services. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h5>Email and SMS Communications:</h5>
	<p>We may communicate with you via email or SMS text message, and we may receive a confirmation when you open an email or read an SMS message sent by us or other users. We use these confirmations to improve our customer service. 
	</p>
	<h5>Information Collected Using Cookies:</h5>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer or mobile device when you access a website. Your browser and/or device may store cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser or device and tell us how and when you use the Services.</li>
			<li>Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser or device has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.</li>
			<li>Most browsers or devices have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser or device software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage of the most attractive features of the Services. </li>
			<li>This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer or device. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h5>Aggregate Information:</h5>
	<p>We collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services (“<u>Aggregate Information</u>”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, or your Account, web browser, or mobile device.</p>
	<h3>How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?</h3>
	<p>The Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the information generated through the Services may be shared with other users or third parties.</p>
	<h5>IP Address and Device Information:</h5>
	<p>While we may collect and store your IP address and/or other information about your device or web browser, that information is not made public. We do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers, and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy. </p>
	<h5>Information You Elect to Share:</h5>
	<p>We may share or disclose information at your direction. Please remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information to other users through the Services, individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.
	<br>
	You may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those Third Party Services from within the Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services’ privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.</p>
	<h5>Aggregate Information:</h5>
	<p>We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.</p>
	<h5>Email or SMS Text Communications with Us:</h5>
	<p>As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email, SMS text messages, and other communications from us, such as communications relating to your Account. Communications relating to your Account will only be sent for purposes important to the Services, such as password recovery. </p>
	<h5>User Profile Information:</h5>
	<p>User profile information including your username, mobile phone number and other information you enter may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services.</p>
	<h5>Information Shared with Our Agents:</h5>
	<p>We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “<u>Agents</u>”). We may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.</p>
	<h5>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:</h5>
	<p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>
	<h5>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:</h5>
	<p>We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention. </p>
	<h5>Information We Share With Your Consent:</h5>
	<p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>
	<h3>Is Information About Me Secure?</h3>
	<p>We store all of our information using industry-standard techniques. However, no security system is 100% secure, so we do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Information or otherwise. Although we seek to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private, we cannot guarantee the security of any Account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. 
	<br>
	Your Account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You should prevent unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately, limiting access to your mobile device, such as by enabling password protection and locking it while it is not in use, and by signing out after you have finished accessing your Account.</p>
	<h3>What Information of Mine Can I Access? </h3>
	<p>If you are a registered user, you can access information associated with your Account by logging into the Services. Registered and unregistered users may be able to access and delete cookies and other browser or device information through their web browser or device settings.
	<br>
	California Privacy Rights: Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: <a href="mailto:hello@chatwala.com">hello@chatwala.com</a> </p>
	<h3>How Can I Delete My Account?</h3>
	<p>Should you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by emailing <a href="mailto:hello@chatwala.com">hello@chatwala.com</a>. If you terminate your Account, any association between your Account and information we store will no longer be accessible through your Account. However, given the nature of sharing on the Services, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion will remain stored on our servers and will remain accessible to the public.</p>
	<h3>What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?</h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
		<li>You can use many of the features of the Services without registering, thereby limiting the type of information that we collect.</li>
		<li>You can always opt not to disclose certain information to us, even though it may be needed to take advantage of some of our features</li>
		<li>You can delete your Account. Please note that we will need to verify that you have the authority to delete the Account, and activity generated prior to deletion will remain stored by us and may be publicly accessible</li>
		<li>You can request that we delete your video messages from our servers. We will do our best to comply with your request promptly, but we cannot guarantee that deletion always occurs within a particular timeframe. Please note that deleting your video messages from our servers does not delete the messages from any recipients’ devices. </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?</h3>
	<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.</p>
	<h3>What If I Have Questions or Concerns?</h3>
	<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, please send us a detailed message to <a href="mailto:hello@chatwala.com">hello@chatwala.com</a>. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
