	<h1>Chatwala Terms of Service</h1>
	<i>Effective Date: January 1, 2014</i>
	<p>Please read these Terms of Service (collectively with Chatwala, Inc.’s Privacy Policy <a href="http://www.chatwala.com/privacy">http://www.chatwala.com/privacy</a>, the “<u>Terms of Service</u>”) fully and carefully before using the Chatwala mobile application (the “<u>Application</u>”) and the services, features, content or applications offered by Chatwala, Inc. (“<u>we</u>”, “<u>us</u>” or “<u>our</u>”) (the “<u>Services</u>”). The Services allow users to have video messaging conversations through a series of short video messages (each, a “<u>Chat</u>”) and automatically recorded videos that capture recipients’ reactions when viewing Chats (each, a “<u>Reaction</u>”). Users can also revisit the priceless moments caught in Chats and Reactions by accessing and viewing their previous conversations through the Services. These Terms of Service set forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the Services. </p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Acceptance of Terms of Service</b>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>By registering for and/or using the Services in any manner, including but not limited to accessing and viewing any Chats you receive, you agree to these Terms of Service and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time through the Services by us, each of which is incorporated by reference and each of which may be updated from time to time without notice to you.</li>
					<li>. Certain of the Services may be subject to additional terms and conditions specified by us from time to time; your use of such Services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into these Terms of Service by this reference.</li>
					<li>These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Services, including, without limitation, users who are contributors of content, information, and other materials or services, registered or otherwise</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li><b>Eligibility</b>. You represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years of age. If you are under age 13, you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the Services to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. You are solely responsible for ensuring that these Terms of Service are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you, and the right to access the Services is revoked where these Terms of Service or use of the Services is prohibited or to the extent offering, sale or provision of the Services conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation. Further, the Services are offered only for your use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party. </li>
			<br>
			<li><b>Registration</b>. You may use the Services without registering for an account on the Services (an “<u>Account</u>”), however, there are many benefits to registering, such as the ability to save and transfer conversations between different devices, including if you later change to a new mobile device. If you choose to register for an Account, you must provide accurate and complete information and keep your Account information updated. You shall not: (i) select or use as a username a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use as a username a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization; or (iii) use, as a username, a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Account, and for keeping your Account password secure. You may never use another person’s user account or registration information for the Services without permission. You must notify us immediately of any change in your eligibility to use the Services or any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account. You should never publish, distribute or post login information for your Account. You shall have the ability to delete your Account by emailing a request to one of our employees or affiliates. </li>
			<br>
			<li>
				<b>Sending Messsages.</b>
				<ol type='a'>
					<li>You can initiate a string of video messages (a “<u>Conversation</u>”) by recording a Chat through the Services and providing the recipient’s mobile phone number. The Services will then send the named recipient an SMS text from your mobile device containing a link to the Conversation, and the recipient will be able to access and view your Chat after downloading the Application and agreeing to these Terms of Service. Please note that text messaging fees may apply to the sending and/or receipt of SMS text messages. Please do not send Chats or initiate Conversations with individuals unless you have at least a reasonable expectation that they would consent to receiving messages these from you. </li>
					<li>After the initial Chat between two specific users, the Conversations will take place through the Application (so no additional text messaging fees should apply). Each time that a Chat is opened, the Application will automatically record the recipient’s reaction using the device’s camera (a “Reaction”). Any Chat sent in response will be accompanied by the Reaction. By sending a Chat, you acknowledge that the recipient of the Chat will also receive a Reaction, and you consent to the Services recording and sending such Reactions.</li>
					<li>When you use the Services to send messages, we collect certain information about you and share this information with the person you send the message to. For example, we share with your message recipient information from your user profile, your video message, and, if one is recorded, your Reaction. By using the Services, you consent to our collection and sharing of such information. </li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li><b>Email and SMS Messages</b>. As part of the Services, we may send messages to you via email or text message. By using the Services, you hereby consent to receiving email and SMS text messages from us. You may opt out of receiving such messages in the future as described in our Privacy Policy <a href="http://www.chatwala.com/privacy">http://www.chatwala.com/privacy.</a> </li>
